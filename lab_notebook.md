We measured in replicate. Guesses were provided without integers

29.7cm in height

~12* measured



Interesting phenomena: 28.5Hz



# Expt 2

Data:
- Str weight: 11g, 
- 320 g ( with hanger)

Measure the length of the string
- 106.4cm


Measure the length to the dot


Estimate the mass required to create the second harmonic at 30Hz


Place the mass and observe. If there's no harmonic, explain. 


Adjust the mass until you get to the second harmonic. Comment on the difference. Calculate tension and uncertainty. 



n = $2 \times f \times L \times \sqrt{\frac{\frac{M}{l}}{\frac{?}{?}}}$



## Expt 3

Vary str length while keeping tension and driving Freq constant

Select T and F to get 6 or 7 harmonics as length if varied. 

34.78

At 7 harmonic
